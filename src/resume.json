      "My cumulation of life decisions has me as a web developer with one eye always on design. Currently, I'm focused on developing in the VueJS and ReactJS frameworks but I'm hungry to contribute to any project in a meaningful way. I love to learn new technologies and add to my toolbelt. I enjoy working in teams but also know the importance of working independently. I'm humble enough to know my limitations, but that also provides my drive to be better.",
