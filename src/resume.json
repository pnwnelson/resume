      "My cumulation of life decisions has me as a web developer with around 3 years of experience. Currently, I'm focused on developing in the VueJS framework but I'm hungry to contribute to any project using any tech stack in a meaningful way. I love to learn new technologies and add to my toolbelt. I enjoy working in teams (onsite or remote) but also know the importance of working independently. I deeply care about product and user experience; I'm always looking to improve both. I'm humble enough to know my limitations, but that also provides my drive to be better.",
